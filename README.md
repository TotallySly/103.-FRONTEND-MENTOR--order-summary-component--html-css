## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

This task really helped continue my understanding of Flexbox, especially when using the container with the Music Icon and the payment plan.

I am really struggling with how to measure the size of the task when compared to what I am trying to make. Not necessarily pixel perfect, but at least a lot closer to the design brief that current.

### Continued development

If there is anyway to find out the size of images etc so I can get better sizing when completing the challenges.
